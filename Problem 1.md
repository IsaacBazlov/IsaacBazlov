Problem 1
-
A car drove $10$ km in eastward direction, turned $90^\circ$ left, drove $4$ km, turned $90^\circ$ left, and drove for $7$ km. The journey took $40$ minutes.

Find: 
- the average speed of the car
- the magnitude of the average velocity of the car

Which is larger? Your answer may contain a diagram.

The total distance travelled is $s=10km+4km+7km =21km$. The time taken is $40 \ min=2/3 \ h$.

The car's average speed is $v=\dfrac{s}{t}=\dfrac{21km}{\frac{2}{3}h}= 31.5 \ km/h$.

The increase in displacement of the car is $10km-7km=3km$ to the east and $4km$ to the north. That is, the change in displacement is $(3km,4km)$. The magnitude of this vector is $\sqrt{(3km)^2+(4km)^2}=\sqrt{25km^2}=5km$. Thus, the magnitude of the average velocity is $\dfrac{5km}{\frac{2}{3}h}=7.5km/h$.

As $31.5km/h > 7.5km/h$, we can see that the average speed of the car is greater than the magnitude of the average velocity of the car.

*Unless the car had moved in a straight line, the average speed would always be greater than the magnitude of the average velocity.*

# Average Speed vs. Magnitude of Average Velocity

## Step 1: Define the Points
- Let point A be the starting point at $(0, 0)$.
- After driving $10$ km east, the car reaches point B at $(10, 0)$.
- After turning left and driving $4$ km north, the car reaches point C at $(10, 4)$.
- After turning left again and driving $7$ km west, the car reaches point D at $(3, 4)$.

## Step 2: Calculate Total Distance and Average Speed
- **Total Distance Traveled:**
  $$10\text{ km} + 4\text{ km} + 7\text{ km} = 21\text{ km}$$

- **Total Time:**
  $$40\text{ minutes} = \frac{40}{60}\text{ hours} = \frac{2}{3}\text{ hours}$$

- **Average Speed:**
  $$\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{21\text{ km}}{\frac{2}{3}\text{ hr}} = 21 \times \frac{3}{2} = 31.5\text{ km/hr}$$

## Step 3: Calculate Displacement and Magnitude of Average Velocity
- **Displacement from A to D:**
  - Eastward displacement: $10 - 7 = 3$ km (east)
  - Northward displacement: $4$ km (north)

- **Magnitude of Displacement:**
  $$\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5\text{ km}$$

- **Magnitude of Average Velocity:**
  $$\text{Average Velocity} = \frac{\text{Displacement}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{5\text{ km}}{\frac{2}{3}\text{ hr}} = 5 \times \frac{3}{2} = 7.5\text{ km/hr}$$

## Step 4: Comparison
- **Average Speed:** $31.5$ km/hr  
- **Magnitude of Average Velocity:** $7.5$ km/hr

Thus, the average speed is larger than the magnitude of the average velocity.

**Final Answers:**
- **Average speed:** $31.5$ km/hr
- **Magnitude of average velocity:** $7.5$ km/hr
- **Which is larger?** The average speed.
